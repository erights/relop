/**
 * By requiring sesshim.es6, if you are not already in a SES
 * environment, you obtain a trivial polyfil of a small bit of SES's
 * API with none of its security. At the moment, you get only
 * <tt>def</tt> and <tt>confine</tt>, but with little of their
 * functionality. More API and more functionality will be provided on
 * an as-needed basis by my current uses, though I will try not to
 * break old clients that were compatible with both SES and
 * sesshim.es6.
 *
 * <p>Currently, even if you are already in a SES environment,
 * sesshim.es6 will ignore that and do the same thing. Once actual SES
 * works on node/iojs/ES6, sesshim.js should test if it is in such an
 * environment, and re-export SES's versions of the APIs that
 * sesshim.es6 does provide, or wrappings that adapt them to ES6.

   *     <tt>opt_options</tt> parameter. An options argument can of
   *     course be provided by the caller, but it will be ignored.
   * <li>The expression can be in the subset of ES6 supported by
   *     Babel.
   * <li>All dangerous globals that are not shadowed, such as "window"
   *     or "document", are still accessible by the evaled expression.
